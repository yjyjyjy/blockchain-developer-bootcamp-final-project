# NFT Browser, Minter, and (stretch goal) Exchange
My final project will be a simple web UI to explore, mint, and (if time allows) trade NFTs.
## Browse
- Anonymous users should be able to see the NFT holdings of an given address
- They should also be able to reverse lookup the holding address of a given NFT token.
## Mint
- Registered users should be able to mint an NFT
## Trade (if timeline allows)
- Registered users should be able purchase or list for sale of their NFT token
